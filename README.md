<!-- personal notes about me: -->
<p>💻I am currently a student in the Software Engineering program at Flatiron School</p>
<p>🤔The decision to learn to program has been one of the best, if not the best, of my career.</p>
<p>👍I am eager to collaborate, review, and network with like minded, self-proclaimed code evangelists.</p>
<p>🌞I am actively seeking assistance/mentoring in my pursuit of a new developer role.</p>
